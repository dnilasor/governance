# Governance
## Charter
The charter defines the scope and governance of the Spinnaker Contributor Experience Special Interest Group.

## Objective
Our community of contributors fuels Spinnaker innovation at scale.  Spinnaker's foothold as the continuous delivery platform that enterprises trust to deliver their workloads to production depends on the active participation of professionals using Spinnaker at those enterprises in identifying and addressing required updates. In order to continue to build and maintain a healthy community, we need to grow our contributor base. To attract and retain new contributors, we must work to create a more inclusive and welcoming project space. To ensure all our contributors are happy and productive in their project work, we must work to eliminate contribution bottlenecks such as pull request latency, volume of open pull requests and open issues, and lack of expert oversight of feature growth opportunties.

## Communications
All are welcome to join our open discussions of SIG-CX and share news, feedback, or concerns related to the group's mission and charter. Much of the group's work may happen outside of SIG-CX meetings, and we encourage project teams to share progress updates or post questions in our Spinnaker Slack #sig-contributor-experience channel.
